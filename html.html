                <p>
                    IC 555 timer was used to indicate the failure of a brake. This was designed in such a
                way that; On Start of Engine, the buzzer goes on when the brake failure is detected.

            <p>
                Braille scripts were used to design this watch, this aids the visually impaired to touch
                and know the time. The servo motor with PWM signals from microcontroller is used to
                set the time. This project was awarded the Best Project Title in the Microcontroller
                Expo conducted by the ECE department.

                An App that was designed to be helpful for the farmers, that gives a detailed report on
                the crops cultivated in Tamil Nadu. Weather report is also displayed, to help foresee
                any adverse conditions. It is equipped with the price and the required amounts of
                pesticides and fertilizers to be used. The price of the pesticides and fertilizers that are
                required is displayed. <span class="highlight">Won first place in IT Innovation Contest </span> as Intra College IT

            <p>
                Face Recognition is a python-based software which uses <span class="highlight">DEEP LEARNING </span>
                computer vision as a basic idea. I used built-in library such as open-cv, dlib to complete
                this project. By this, Attendance of particular online class can be monitored using WEB
                CAM, Thus the data of a student attendance, including the Time duration of students
                attended is displaced in the excel Worksheet.
